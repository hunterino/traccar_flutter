- Eliminated memory leak risk from singleton pattern

**5. TraccarFlutterPlugin.kt** (android/src/main/kotlin/.../TraccarFlutterPlugin.kt)
- Updated method calls to pass Activity reference where needed
- Ensured no Activity references are retained unnecessarily

**6. build.gradle** (android/build.gradle)

  - `kotlinx-coroutines-test:1.7.3`
  - `androidx.test:core:1.5.0`
  - `robolectric:4.11.1`

#### Flutter Layer (Dart)

**1. pubspec.yaml**
- Added `mocktail:^1.0.0` for mocking in tests

**2. Test Files (New)**
- **test/traccar_flutter_test.dart**
  - 6 tests covering main API methods
  - Tests for `initTraccar()`, `setConfigs()`, `startService()`, `stopService()`, `showStatusLogs()`
  - Uses mocktail for platform mocking

- **test/entity/traccar_configs_test.dart**
  - 3 tests for `TraccarConfigs` entity
  - Tests data serialization with `toMap()`
  - Tests default values and accuracy level mapping

#### Android Test Files (New)

**1. DatabaseHelperTest.kt**
- 7 comprehensive tests for database operations
- Tests coroutine-based async methods
- Tests insert, select, delete operations
- Tests error handling

**2. RequestManagerTest.kt**
- 5 tests for network request handling
- Tests invalid URL handling
- Tests timeout scenarios
- Tests Result type structure

**3. ProtocolFormatterTest.kt**
- 7 tests for URL formatting
- Tests parameter inclusion (device ID, lat/lon, timestamp, etc.)
- Tests data serialization format

3. Migrate to Room database (type-safe database access)
4. Implement structured error handling across all layers
5. Fix iOS HTTP status code checking
6. Add database size limits and cleanup
7. Fix force unwraps in iOS
8. Update deprecated CLLocationManager APIs

**Estimated Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Expected Benefits:**
- Improved battery efficiency
- Better location accuracy
- More reliable networking
- Easier debugging and maintenance
