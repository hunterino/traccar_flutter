# Android APK Build Fix

## Problem

The Android APK build was failing with the following error:

```
Failed to transform bcprov-jdk18on-1.80.jar using Jetifier.
Reason: IllegalArgumentException, message: Unsupported class file major version 65.
```

This error occurred because Jetifier (an old Android migration tool) doesn't support Java 21 class files (major version 65).

## Solution

Disabled Jetifier in both gradle.properties files since it's no longer needed for modern Android projects.

### Files Changed

1. **`android/gradle.properties`**
2. **`example/android/gradle.properties`**

Changed:
```properties
android.enableJetifier=true
```

To:
```properties
android.enableJetifier=false
```

## Build Results

After this fix, both debug and release APKs build successfully:

- ✅ **Debug APK**: 142 MB (`app-debug.apk`)
- ✅ **Release APK**: 47 MB (`app-release.apk`)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Debug build
flutter build apk --debug

# Release build
flutter build apk --release
```

### Output Location

```
example/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
├── app-debug.apk        (142 MB)
├── app-debug.apk.sha1
├── app-release.apk      (47 MB)
└── app-release.apk.sha1
```

## What is Jetifier?

Jetifier was a migration tool used to convert old Android Support Library dependencies to AndroidX. Since this project already uses AndroidX exclusively and all modern dependencies support AndroidX natively, Jetifier is no longer needed and can cause compatibility issues with newer Java versions.

## Remaining Warnings

These warnings don't affect the build but should be addressed in the future:

1. **Gradle version**: 8.3.0 → Upgrade to 8.7.0+
2. **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.2.1 → Upgrade to 8.6.0+
3. **Kotlin version**: 1.9.22 → Upgrade to 2.1.0+
4. **Java source/target**: Version 8 is obsolete → Upgrade to version 11+

These are tracked in the technical debt documentation.
